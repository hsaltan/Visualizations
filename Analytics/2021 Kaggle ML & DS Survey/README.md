Analysis made on the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. The analysis used narratives and plots to compare two groups of data scientists. The first group (novices) is the data scientists who have 1 year or less programming experience. The second group (veterans) is the data scientists who have 20 or more years of programming experience.

The studys aims to show the differences between the groups, as to who is better at what and how much.

The analysis used Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Pandas, and external data and sources as well.
